1. See if "Spot" is present in the following hash
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

ages.key?("Spot")
ages.assoc("Spot")
ages.has_key?("Spot")
ages.include?("Spot")
ages.member("Spot")

2. Convert the string in the following ways (code will be executed on original munsters_description above):
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

"tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."
"The munsters are creepy in a good way."
"the munsters are creepy in a good way."
"THE MUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."

munsters_description.swapcase!
munsters_description.capitalize!
munsters_description.downcase!
munsters_description.upcase!

3. Add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }
additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

ages.merge!(additional_ages)

4. See if the name "Dino" appears in the string below:
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

advice.include? "Dino"
advice.match?("Dino")

5. Show an easier way to write this array:
flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

6. How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

flintstones << "Dino"

7. In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flintstones << "Dino"
We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.
How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
flintstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy")
flintstones.concat(%w(Dino Hoppy))

8. Remove everything starting from "house".
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". 
But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".
As a bonus, what happens if you use the String#slice method instead?

advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))
Slice (without the exclamation point) will return the part that was sliced but the overall variable remains unmutated.

9. Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:
statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"

statement.count('t')

10. Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. 
If we had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members, 
how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?
title = "Flintstone Family Members"

title.center(40)
